Can I use .php files
""""""""""""""""""""

Yes,
some plugins are Script plugins which ship in .php form and can be installed by putting them in the plugins folder. More on `this forum thread <forumthread_>`_.
Plugins in a folder containg many php files and a plugin.yml can be loaded only when the `DevTools`_ plugin is installed and the plugin/PocketMine API versions are both the same.
Take a look at the :doc:`plugin example </plugins>`
