Can I install PocketMine-MP on a 32-bit computer or OS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for 32-bit has been dropped.
You cannot install PocketMine-MP on a 32-bit computer, but your processor might support 64-bit, in which case you can install a 64-bit OS to run PocketMine-MP.
